# letter-digit-recognition
Using Kaggle data for recognising digits 
taking the data into consideration using linear and non linear Support vector machine algorithm and hyperparameters for building model

Also using the MNIST data to recognise letters
Similarly as digit using liear and non-linear Support vector machine algorithms for predicting the digits and letters with high accuracy.
